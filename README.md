# Front-end guidelines

## Overview

These guidelines are destined for all front-end developers in SoftyLines.

The first step any new developer should take before starting on a production project is to read these guidelines and use only the company starters.

You should not create your own starter for a production project.

These guidelines allow us to :
 - Ensure consistent code quality across all our projects
 - Facilitate collaboration among multiple developers working on the same codebase
 -
 -....

## Contributing

The developer is not free to choose his own architecture and starter; he should follow the guidelines.
The quality and consistency of code are more important that the developer freedom, but we welcome any suggestion that will ameliorate there guidelines.
If you have any amelioration or suggestion you should create a suggestion/new-update-name branch with a detailed commit described why you want to update or add guideline
